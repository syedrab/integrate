									<p><strong><em>Hold On To Your Kids: Why Parents Need To Matter More </em></strong></p>
									<p><strong>By Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Mate (2008)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>Scientists, educators, and parents of teens have long recognized the potency of peer influences on children and youth, but until recently, questions of how and why adolescents emulate their peers were largely overlooked. This book presents a comprehensive framework for understanding the processes by which peers shape each other's attitudes and behavior, and explores implications for intervention and prevention. Leading authorities share compelling findings on such topics as how drug use, risky sexual behavior, and other deviant behaviors "catch on" among certain peer groups or cliques; the social, cognitive, developmental, and contextual factors that strengthen or weaken the power of peer influence; and the nature of positive peer influences and how to support them.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>

Author of the award-winning <em>Social Skills Picture Book </em>series, Dr. Jed Baker offers parents and teachers strategies for preventing and managing meltdowns. His 20+ years of experience working with children on the autism spectrum, combined with his personal experiences raising his own children, have yielded time-tested strategies, and results. Dr. Baker offers an easy-to-follow, 4-step model that will improve your everyday relationships with the children in your life: 1) managing your own emotions by adjusting your expectations, 2) learning strategies to calm a meltdown in the moment, 3) understanding why a meltdown occurs, and 4) creating plans to prevent future meltdowns.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>

									<p><strong><em>Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child </em></strong></p>

									<p><strong>By Dr. Jed Baker (2001)&nbsp;</strong></p>
									<p>Winner of an iParenting Media Award, this book uses photographs of students engaging in a variety of real-life social situations. The realistic format plays to the visual strengths of children on the autism spectrum to teach appropriate social behaviours. Color photographs illustrate the "right way" and "wrong way" to approach each situation and the positive/negative consequences of each. A facilitator (parent, teacher, etc.) is initially needed to explain each situation, and ask questions such as "What is happening in this picture?" Children role-play skills until confident enough to practice them in real-life interactions.</p>

Based on yoga and tai chi movements, these simple, effective exercises reduce mental, physical, and emotional stress. The book introduces the program to the general public. The ten routines are designed to be easily accessible and can be performed by people of all ages and all body types, whether they're familiar with mindful practices or not. They can be done before or after sitting meditation, at home, at work, or any time the reader has a few minutes to refresh both mind and body. For those new to meditation, the exercises are an easy way to get acquainted with mindfulness as a complete, multifaceted practice. For current practitioners, the movements add a welcome physical element to a sitting meditation practice.</span></p>

From Canada&rsquo;s bestselling and trusted parenting authority comes this honest and authoritative compendium of advice for parents who are living with children who have mental illnesses. It features interviews with experts on children&rsquo;s mental health as well as parents and young people who have lived with (or who are living with) mental illness. Drawing on her own experience and expertise, Ann shows how to cope with years of worry and frustration about a child&rsquo;s behaviour; how to effectively advocate for the child and work through treatments; how to manage siblings&rsquo; concerns and emotions; and, most importantly, how to thrive as a family.</span></p>
