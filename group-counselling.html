												<h4>TRIPLE P- Positive Parenting Program</h4>
												<!--br><h4>Parent/Guardian Support</h4-->
												<br>
												<h4>What is Triple P?</h4>

												<p >Group Triple P is an 8-session program, which assists parents/guardians to develop positive discipline strategies to improve their relationship with their child. This program has been developed to ensure that group sessions are interactive and that parents/guardians are given opportunities to practice newly learned skills in between sessions.
													<br><br></p>



												<h4>What Can I Expect?</h4>

												<p >Parents/guardians will learn to set clear and consistent expectations, increase their child’s compliance and learn strategies to manage common misbehaviours.

													<br><br>Key Goals of Group Triple P:
												<ul>
													<li> Promote a good parent/child relationship</li>
													<li> Encourage positive behavior (behaviours you’d like to see more often)</li>
													<li> Teach children new skills and behaviours</li>
													<li> Set rules and give instructions that your children will follow</li>
													<li> Respond to misbehaviour immediately, consistently and decisively</li>
													<li> Use positive discipline strategies that work</li>
													<li> Take care of yourself as a parent/guardian</li>
												</ul>
												<br><br></p>


												<h4>Telephone Support Sessions</h4>

												<p >Telephone consultations are provided during weeks 5, 6 and 7. These sessions are designed to assist parent(s)/guardian(s) with the implementation of positive parenting skills at home. Parent(s)/guardian(s) will be encouraged to implement and monitor these skills and set additional target behaviours. Telephone sessions help to tailor the program to meet the needs of individual families and to promote generalization of skills across a diverse range of settings. Telephone sessions provide parent(s)/guardian(s) with opportunities to ask questions, address successes and challenges and problem-solve difficulties. Each telephone consult session is 20 min in length.

												<h4>READY, SET, PLAY (CAMP)</h4>
												<br>
												<h4>SOCIAL SKILLS PLAY GROUP- ABA FOCUSED (AGES 3-7)</h4>
												<br>
												<h4>What is ‘Ready, Set, Play’?</h4>

												<p >‘Ready, Set, Play’ is a Social Skills program that is designed for children to learn and practice appropriate social exchanges within a supportive and therapeutic play based environment.

													<br><br>Children with a developmental delay or barrier may require assistance in the areas of social interaction and communication during play. Within this group your child will be exposed to therapeutic social situations with peers and adults, in which appropriate interactions will be fostered. This program will teach children the tools required to effectively and appropriately engage in play with the goal of developing sustainable and meaningful interactions.
													<br><br>
												</p>

												<h4>The Importance of Play</h4>

												<p >Play is critically important to healthy brain development. Through play children learn to socialize, to develop physically, cognitively and emotionally and to meaningfully engage with the world around them. Children learn to practice verbal communication (understanding of spoken language and producing their own), non-verbal communication (understanding of gestures), roleplaying real life situations and emerging empathetic skills. Social maturity and social awareness are achieved as play evolves and becomes more sophisticated.
													<br><br>
												</p>

												<h4>What is Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA)?</h4>

													<p >The ‘Ready, Set, Play’ group is developed using the principles of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA). ABA is a treatment method that has been clinically proven to help children learn new skills. In ABA programs, skills are broken down into their simplest components and taught in a step-by-step progression.

														<br><br></p>


													<h4>What Can You Expect?</h4>

													<p >This group will focus on helping your child to develop the following skills:
													<ul>
														<li> Emotional Regulation (managing expression of feelings)</li>
														<li> Appropriate manipulation of toys</li>
														<li> Turn taking and sharing</li>
														<li> Extended joint attention skills (sharing common interest with another person)</li>
														<li> Attend to group instruction (listening, following direction)</li>
														<li> Self-Awareness (personal space, boundaries)</li>
														<li> Non-verbal communication (facial expression, body language)</li>
													</ul>
